              you've been trained in how to splint and professional help isn't readily available, apply a splint to the
              area above and below the fracture sites. Padding the splints can help reduce discomfort.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="section__description">Don't remove large or deeply embedded objects. Don't probe the wound or
              attempt to clean it yet. Your first job is to stop the bleeding. Wear disposable protective gloves if
              available.</p>

            <p class="section__description">Place a sterile bandage or clean cloth on the wound. Press the bandage
              firmly with your palm to control bleeding. Apply constant pressure until the bleeding stops. Maintain
              pressure by binding the wound with a thick bandage or a piece of clean cloth. Don't put direct pressure on
              an eye injury or embedded object.
              Secure the bandage with adhesive tape or continue to maintain pressure with your hands. If possible, raise
              an injured limb above the level of the heart.</p>

            <p class="section__description">If the bleeding seeps through the gauze or other cloth on the wound, add
              another bandage on top of it. And keep pressing firmly on the area.</p>

            <p class="section__description"> A tourniquet is effective in controlling life-threatening bleeding from a
              limb. Apply a tourniquet if you're trained in how to do so. When emergency help arrives, explain how long
              the tourniquet has been in place.</p>
