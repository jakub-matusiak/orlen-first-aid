                If anyone's injured, get on the phone with emergency services or ask a bystander to call for help.</p>

              <h2 class="section__heading">Step 3: Get to safety.</h2>
              <p class="section__description">If you're able to, move to the side of the road or a sidewalk. If your car
                is safe to drive and is causing a hazard where it is, pull it to the side of the road. Otherwise, leave
                it where it is and get yourself to safety.</p>
              <img class="section__image" src="/assets/img/car-accident.jpg" alt="">
              <h2 class="section__heading">Step 4: Call 112.</h2>
              <p class="section__description">Whether an accident is considered a minor fender-bender or a major
                collision, calling the police is important â€” and in some states, it's legally required. The responding
                officers will fill out an accident report and document the scene. If the police can't come to the scene
                of the accident, you can go to the nearest police station and complete a report yourself, according to
                the III. When you file a claim with your insurer, they may ask for a copy of the police report to help
                with the claims process.</p>
              <img class="section__image" src="/assets/img/car-accident.jpg" alt="">
              <h2 class="section__heading">Step 5: Wait for help.</h2>
              <p class="section__description">Turn off your engine, turn on your hazard lights and use the road flares
                in your emergency car kit to warn other vehicles to slow down.</p>
              <img class="section__image" src="/assets/img/car-accident.jpg" alt="">
              <h2 class="section__heading">Step 6: Exchange information.</h2>
              <p class="section__description">After making sure you and any passengers are uninjured, exchange contact
                and insurance information with the other driver. According to the III, here's the most important
                information drivers should exchange after an accident:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Full name and contact information</li>
                <li>Insurance company and policy number</li>
                <li>Driver's license and license plate number</li>
                <li>Type, color and model of vehicle</li>
                <li>Location of accident</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="section__description">The III recommends that you avoid discussing fault when going over the
                facts with the other driver. When you file an insurance claim, the adjuster reviewing your claim will
                determine who's at fault based on an inspection of the vehicles/property damaged, information provided
                by you and the other parties involved in the accident, and any supporting documentation, like the police
                report or photographs from the scene.</p>
              <img class="section__image" src="/assets/img/car-accident.jpg" alt="">
              <h2 class="section__heading">Step 7: Document the accident.</h2>
              <p class="section__description">In order to help protect yourself, the III recommends taking the following
                steps:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Identify the officers.</li>
                <li>Get a copy.</li>
                <li>ITake pictures.</li>
                <li>Take down names.</li>
                <li>Talk to witnesses.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="section__description">To help keep all of this documentation in order, you can keep this
                accident information page in your vehicle.</p>
              <img class="section__image" src="/assets/img/car-accident.jpg" alt="">
              <h2 class="section__heading">Step 8: Notify your insurer and start the claims process.</h2>
              <p class="section__description">You may want to call your insurance agent while you're at the scene. That
                way, they can tell you exactly what they will need to in order to process your claim and what to expect
                during the claims process. An accident can leave even the most seasoned driver frazzled, but following
                these steps may help protect you from unnecessary worries. That way, you can focus on working with your
                insurance company to get your vehicle repaired as smoothly and as quickly as possible.</p>

              an eye injury or embedded object.
              Secure the bandage with adhesive tape or continue to maintain pressure with your hands. If possible, raise
              an injured limb above the level of the heart.</p>
